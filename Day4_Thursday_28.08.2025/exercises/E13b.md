2. Clear "free text search box" and search for "modern". Navigate to the seismology category and press star icon next to "Parameters of modern earthquakes (1998-present) - FDSN event". Change icons of these earthquakes to smaller orange filled stars.

3. Clear "free text search box" and search for "moment". Navigate to the seismology category and press star icon next to "Moment tensor data for modern earthquakes (2013-present)".

4. Export the list of historical earthquakes a) from table view, at the right side of the portal (in CSV format); b) From the services download menu, within advanced search filters (in geo+json format).

- Yes
- No
- I don't know
- I don't understand the question

Q2.4: What is the length of the fault closest to the 1755 earthquake location?

## Task 1 - Faults

Go to the EPOS Data Portal (dev branch) now and execute the following:

1. Go to Filters in the upper left corner and press the down arrow. Specify coordinates by typing in:  
N:40, S:35, W:-12, E:-6, then press confirm.  
Zoom a little out (with the minus symbol in the upper right corner) to see the blue bounding box you created.

2. Navigate to "free text search" in the upper left corner and search for "fault".  
Navigate to the seismology icon and press the star icon next to "European Fault Source Model 2020 - Crustal Faults (OGC WFS)" to add the service to your favourites.

Q1.1: What faulting type is dominant in the selected area?  

- Reverse (R)
- Right-Lateral (RL)
- Left-Lateral (LL)
- Normal (N)
- I didn't manage to find

Hint for the service visualization - the area and visualization should look like this. The type of faulting is described in a pop-up for individual faults as "faulttype" (just click on a fault in the map). For summary overview switch to table view, add new column "faulttype" and scan for the dominant type in the table.  
Extra: If you use WMS (instead of WFS) you can open the map control tool to see the map legend with indicated colors.

Did you need to use the hint?
